These `Venomous.SnakeWorker` are managed and supervised with `Venomous.SnakeManager` GenServer to allow concurrent and efficient execution of Python code. The `Snakes` pids and python pids are stored inside `:ets` table and the Processes are handled by `DymanicSupervisor` called `Venomous.SnakeSupervisor`. The unused `Snakes` get automatically killed by `SnakeManager` depending on the given configuration.","ref":"Venomous.html","title":"Venomous","type":"module"},{"doc":"- `python/2`: The primary function to execute a Python function.
